# 🧠 AI Bias Bounty 2025 – Loan Approval Bias Detection

## 📌 Problem Statement
We aim to detect and analyze bias in loan approval predictions using a synthetic dataset. The project helps highlight real-world risks of demographic bias in automated decision-making systems.

## 🧠 Model Summary
We used a Logistic Regression model to predict loan approvals.  
Key steps:
- Cleaned and preprocessed the data (encoded categorical variables, scaled features).
- Trained and validated the model.
- Performed fairness checks on multiple attributes like Gender, Race, Disability Status, Language Proficiency, and Zip Code Group.

## ⚖️ Fairness Considerations
We visualized bias across sensitive attributes using approval rate plots.  
Significant disparities in approval rates were observed, especially across gender and racial groups.  
Visuals and fairness reports are provided in the `outputs/bias_plots` and `reports` folders.
