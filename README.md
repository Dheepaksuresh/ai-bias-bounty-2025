# 📂 AI Bias Bounty Hackathon

Welcome to the AI Bias Bounty Hackathon!

Join us as we explore, detect, and report biases in AI models and datasets. This is an exciting opportunity to contribute to ethical AI while building your skills and network.


# 🚀 Overview

The **AI Bias Bounty Hackathon** challenges participants to build machine learning models and generate technical reports that identify and address bias within provided datasets.
The goal is to encourage the development of fair and responsible AI systems.
